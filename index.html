    <p>The Philippines comprises more than 7,107 islands tucked between the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea; its location placed the Philippines within the path of migration and trade for thousands and thousands of years. And with migrating humans come new ingredients, dishes, and traditions.</p>
    <p>Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation.</p>
