    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This longganisa pasta is the perfect dish for those who want a lighter version of another pasta classic, spaghetti bolognese. Like the latter, a deliciously vibrant red sauce coats all the components of your longganisa pasta; the mix of both tomato sauce and paste will certainly do the trick! But unlike bolognese which makes use of ground meat in its sauce, longganisa pasta incorporates the titular meat through thick and chunky slices. Each bite is more flavorful and filling than the last, and makes your dish even more delicious! </p>
